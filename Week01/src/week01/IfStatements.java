		// Exercise 1
		// Assume a variable x contains a double value. 
		// Write an if-else statement that multiplies it by itself 
		// if the value is greater than 1. Otherwise it should divide it by 2.
		
		//Exercise 1.5
		//Using an if statement and the modulus (%) operator write a program that 
		// asks users to enter a number and determines whether 
		// the number entered is even or odd.
		
		//Ask user an input
		//Convert input to number
		//if reminder of number / 2 is 0, print is even, otherwise print odd

		//What's wrong with the following block of code?
		/*if(accountBalance = 0){
		        System.out.println(“No money in your account!”);

		// Exercise 5
		// What is the value of !!frozen?
		//when frozen is true, !!frozen is  ____
		//when frozen is false, !!frozen is ____


		//Exercise 6
		//Suppose x and y are two integers. 
		//How do you test whether both of them are zero?
		//How do you test whether at least one of them is zero?
		//How do you test whether exactly one of them is zero?
